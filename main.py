    #   it can draw itself
    #       you can show a picture of the hangman (ASCII art)
    #       you can show the letters guessed
    #       you can show the correct letters in the correct positions
    #   you can ask it if you have won
    #   you can ask it if hangman has won
    #   you can put in letters (hangman can check this input for you)
